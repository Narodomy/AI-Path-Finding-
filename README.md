## A word of caution <a name = "caution"></a>

Even though the code that I made is open source, I'm not sure about the game's code license. I obtained it from [here](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-worlds-hardest-game) with [this Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/abpdnfjocnmdomablahdcfnoggeeiedb), which allows me to download all the resourcers from a website. From there, it was just a matter of cleaning up the HTML and reading through the game's JS code.

## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is meant to be a prototype of a genetic algorithm that's able to generate a neural network capable of playing the World's Hardest Game.
