# WorldsHardestGameAI

This repository contains the AI pathfinding implementation for the "World's Hardest Game" developed as a project for the Artificial Intelligence (AI) class during my Bachelor's degree at King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok (KMUTNB).

## Project Overview

The "World's Hardest Game" is a notoriously challenging browser game that requires precise navigation through a maze-like environment. This project focuses on implementing AI algorithms to autonomously solve the game.

## Key Features

* **Pathfinding Algorithms:**
    * Implemented various pathfinding algorithms, such as A* search, to find optimal or near-optimal paths.
    * Explored and compared the performance of different algorithms in the context of the game's complex environment.
* **Game State Representation:**
    * Developed a representation of the game state that allows the AI to effectively reason about the environment.
    * Implemented methods to extract relevant information from the game, such as player position, obstacles, and goal locations.
* **AI Agent Control:**
    * Created an AI agent that can interact with the game, control the player character, and execute the calculated paths.
* **Educational Purpose:**
    * This project was primarily developed for educational purposes, demonstrating the practical application of AI pathfinding techniques.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd WorldsHardestGameAI
    ```

2.  **Dependencies:**

    * Install any required libraries or dependencies (e.g., Python libraries for AI algorithms, browser automation tools if used). Refer to the project's documentation or requirements file.

3.  **Running the AI Agent:**

    * Follow the instructions in the project's documentation to run the AI agent. This may involve running a Python script or executing a browser extension.

4.  **Configuration**
    * If the code needs any configuration, such as file paths, or game specific settings, modify the config files or variables within the code.

## Contents

* **AI Algorithms:**
    * Implementation of pathfinding algorithms (e.g., A*).
    * Code for game state representation and manipulation.
* **Game Interface:**
    * Code for interacting with the "World's Hardest Game" (e.g., browser automation, game state extraction).
* **Project Documentation:**
    * Reports, presentations, or other documentation related to the project.
